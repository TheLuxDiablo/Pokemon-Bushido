	- add an unawakened katana version
	- maybe separate fly and cut
	- Maybe just make cut the first function, cuz its a sword. We could cut to the south, to learn solid strikes, and then go north
	- make the katana's healing energy only revive pokemon when it's in its final form
		- Form 0 = unawakened, only useful for cutting down trees
		- Form 1 = awakened, can now steal shadow pokemon and heal pokemon in our team. REMOVE THE MAP ABILITY
		- Form 2 = solid strike learned, can now cut through rocks
		- Form 3 = wind blade learned, can now fly
		- Form 4 = water walking technique, can now run on water
		- Form 5 = light blade!!!! Final form!!! Can purify on the go, illuminate caves, and banish fog!
