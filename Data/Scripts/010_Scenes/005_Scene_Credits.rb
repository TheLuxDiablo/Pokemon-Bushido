#    $scene = Scene_Credits.new

## New Edit 3/6/2007 11:14 PM by AvatarMonkeyKirby.
# Ok, what I've done is changed the part of the script that was supposed to make
# the credits automatically end so that way they actually end! Yes, they will
# actually end when the credits are finished! So, that will make the people you
# should give credit to now is: Unknown, MiDas Mike, and AvatarMonkeyKirby.
#                                             -sincerly yours,
#                                               Your Beloved
# Oh yea, and I also added a line of code that fades out the BGM so it fades
# sooner and smoother.
#
## New Edit 24/1/2012 by Maruno.
# Added the ability to split a line into two halves with <s>, with each half
# aligned towards the centre. Please also credit me if used.
#
## New Edit 22/2/2012 by Maruno.
# Credits now scroll properly when played with a zoom factor of 0.5. Music can
# now be defined. Credits can't be skipped during their first play.
#
## New Edit 25/3/2020 by Maruno.
# Scroll speed is now independent of frame rate. Now supports non-integer values
# for CreditsScrollSpeed.
#
## New Edit 21/8/2020 by Marin.
# Now automatically inserts the credits from the plugins that have been
# registered through the PluginManager module.
